        <h2>Welcome to your next vacay hotspot!</h2>
        <p>Built on one of oldest active Los Angeles film studio lots, 
        <a href="https://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/web/en/us">Universal Studios Hollywood</a>
           stands proud as the first park to be created as part of the Universal Studios theme park 
           line that would spread across the world. Universal Studios Hollywood first opened as a 
           theme park in 1964, after being a working film studio since 1912. Over a hundred years since
           it's initial grand opening, the studio is still one of the largest and most powerful in the 
           film industry. The theme park still attracts thousands of attendees daily also. 
           The park offers a variety of thrilling attractions and entertainment such as live action-packed 
           shows and immersive simulations. The goal of this site is to offer easily-accessible information 
           for tourists from all around the world who might be interested in visiting the park.
